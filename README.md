ASP.NET Core with EF / Web Application


This project is a MVC Web Application developed for one of my courses in university. 

The project can establish connection with MS SQL Server and write into it. The database created by this Application has three tables which contain 
1 one-to-many and 1 many-to-many relationships.

In the Media folder inside the repository you can find a picture of the tables with their respective relationships and also there is a brief Walkthrough video of 
the UI of the Web Application.
